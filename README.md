# Lists of Valour

A cross-platform app to store lists of things.

## "How boring"? No, not boring..

Do you, like me, have dozens of IMDB tabs open as reminders of films and shows that you might like to watch? Well fret ye no more friend, for this will be a simple way to save them conveniently and have them display in a sortable list with imdb ratings, posters, notes and suchlike.

NB: Might shift to 'Movies of Valour' with 'Lists of' as a dependency :)
