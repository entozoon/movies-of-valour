# Movies of Valour

A cross-platform app to store a list of movies.

## "How boring"? No, not boring!

Do you, like me, have dozens of IMDB tabs open as reminders of films that you might like to watch? Well, fret ye no more friend, for this will be a simple way to save them conveniently; displayed in a sortable list with IMDB ratings, posters, notes, DVD release dates and who knows what else!

## Technologies

- Firebase
- Electron.io

## Is it complete?

Who knows! It's a personal project and, like all my tools, I build them from necessity (so, fervently but.. sporadically).

## Installation (dev)
